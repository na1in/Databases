# Flight Booking System 

Developed a working prototype of a flight booking system that connects to a database stored on MS Azure, allowing customers to use the command line interface to search, book, and reserve flights. To do the same I worked with JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API, prepared statements in Java and SQL, and tested the application by 20+ test cases using Maven Unit Testing Framework.
